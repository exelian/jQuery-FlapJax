FlapJax bindings for jQuery
===========================

FlapJax is a monadic implementation for functional reactive programming in Javascript. Combining it
with jQuery gives us the best of both world. A nice clean way of interaction with events and user
interactions and jQuery for it sublime selector support and event normalization.

This project is the first step to a larger library and a test bed for my own work. The libraries are
stable and (as far as I can tell) as bug free as they can get.

Currently using:
- jQuery 1.6.2
- FlapJax 2.1
